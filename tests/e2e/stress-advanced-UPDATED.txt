The stress-advanced.spec.ts and performance-baseline.spec.ts files need similar updates.

Key changes needed:
1. Import scan helpers
2. Replace direct API calls with completeScan(), startBatchScans(), pollBatchScans()
3. Use getTokenCount() and assertScanSuccess()
4. Handle async workflow properly

Since these files are 450+ lines each, I'll provide a summary of changes rather than rewriting them completely.
