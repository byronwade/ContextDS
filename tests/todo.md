## Pending Improvements üîÑ

### High Priority
- [ ] Integrate actual debugger agent for automated fixes
- [ ] Implement fixes identified by recursive loop:
  - [ ] Increase timeout threshold (120s ‚Üí 180s)
  - [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [ ] Implement memory streaming for large CSS files
  - [ ] Add rate limiting middleware
  - [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Add real-time progress monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Create test result visualization (charts/graphs)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add snapshot testing for token extraction
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing for extracted layouts
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking against Project Wallace
- [ ] Create test data generators for edge cases
- [ ] Add mutation testing to validate test quality
- [ ] Implement test parallelization with multiple processes
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add browser-based E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Create test mocking utilities for external dependencies
- [ ] Add contract testing for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for token validation
- [ ] Create load testing scenarios for production scale
- [ ] Add chaos engineering tests (random failures)
- [ ] Create performance profiling tools

## Future Enhancements üöÄ
- [ ] Machine learning model for predicting scan success
- [ ] Automated fix suggestion system with confidence scores
- [ ] Integration with monitoring/alerting systems
- [ ] Real-time test result streaming
- [ ] Multi-region test execution
- [ ] A/B testing framework for scanner improvements
- [ ] Historical trend analysis and reporting

## Known Issues üêõ
- [ ] Some Fortune 500 sites block automated scanning (need user agent rotation)
- [ ] Memory usage spikes on very large CSS files (need streaming)
- [ ] Timeout issues with slow-loading sites (need progressive timeout)
- [ ] Concurrent scan failures at high load (need circuit breaker)

## Notes üìù
- Test suite designed for recursive improvement workflow
- Focus on automated error detection and fix recommendation
- Comprehensive reporting for debugging and tracking progress
- Graduated difficulty testing (high ‚Üí medium ‚Üí low priority sites)
- Integration with debugger agent for automated fixes
